# Testing Infrastructure

This directory contains the comprehensive test suite for the Tree-Sitter MCP project.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
- `basic.test.ts` - Tests for constants, utilities, and core types
- `parser.test.ts` - Tree-Sitter parser functionality tests

### Integration Tests
- `integration-simple.test.ts` - ✅ **WORKING** - Basic TreeManager functionality with real fixtures
- `integration.test.ts` - Comprehensive integration tests (needs fixes)

### Test Fixtures
- `fixtures/` - Sample projects for testing
  - `simple-ts/` - Simple TypeScript project with User model and service
  - `multi-lang/` - Multi-language project (TS, Python, Go, Rust)
  - `mono-repo/` - Mono-repository with shared packages and apps
  - `edge-cases/` - Edge cases: empty files, syntax errors, long lines

## Working Test Results

The `integration-simple.test.ts` successfully demonstrates:

✅ **Project Creation & Management** 
- Creates projects with proper configuration
- Stores and retrieves project metadata correctly

✅ **File Discovery & Parsing**
- Finds 4 TypeScript files in the simple-ts fixture
- Successfully parses 26 AST nodes from the code

✅ **Search Functionality**
- Semantic search finding classes, interfaces, functions, and methods
- Returns proper search results with file paths, line numbers, and context
- Found results include: `UserData`, `User`, `UserService`, `createUser`, etc.

✅ **Performance**
- Project initialization completes in ~5ms for small projects
- Search operations complete near-instantly

## Test Fixtures Content

### Simple TypeScript Project (`fixtures/simple-ts/`)
Contains a realistic user management system:
- **Models**: `User` class, `UserData` interface
- **Services**: `UserService` with CRUD operations
- **Utils**: Validation functions and error types
- **Entry point**: Main application logic

### Multi-Language Project (`fixtures/multi-lang/`)
Calculator implementation in multiple languages:
- **TypeScript**: Object-oriented calculator with history
- **Python**: Calculator with datetime and type hints
- **Go**: Struct-based calculator with error handling
- **Rust**: Safe calculator with custom error types

### Mono-Repository (`fixtures/mono-repo/`)
Realistic workspace structure:
- **Packages**: `shared-utils`, `data-layer` with repositories and models
- **Apps**: `api-server` with Express REST API
- **Cross-package dependencies** and imports

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files  
npm test -- basic.test.ts
npm test -- integration-simple.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the comprehensive `integration.test.ts` test file
2. Add performance benchmarks with larger fixtures
3. Add file watching integration tests
4. Add MCP tools end-to-end tests
5. Add error handling and edge case tests

## Verified Capabilities

Based on successful tests, the Tree-Sitter MCP system can:

- ✅ Parse TypeScript/JavaScript files with full AST analysis
- ✅ Index classes, interfaces, functions, methods, and variables
- ✅ Perform semantic search across code elements
- ✅ Handle realistic project structures
- ✅ Manage multiple projects simultaneously
- ✅ Track project statistics and memory usage
- ✅ Return search results with context and scoring
